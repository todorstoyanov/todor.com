			"Text": "These were exciting times. Having a computer at home was considered special. Floppy disks were an important part of computing, but many viruses spread through them. Norton Commander was a great interface for managing files and folders, providing a starting point for essential activities such as copying data and running programs. Borland Turbo Pascal and Turbo C were great tools for creating programs.<br><br>Then came Windows 3.11, and Program Manager offered a radical new interface. Word 6 and Excel 5 dominated and did a great job. Corel Draw filled the gap for vector graphics, while Borland Delphi made Windows programming easy. To connect to the internet, a modem and Trumpet Winsock were used.<br><br>Windows 95 brought the famous Start button. Borland C Builder became the key to Win32, but applications were difficult to create.",

			"Text": "These were exciting times for the internet. After the exploration of FTP and IRC, websites began to gain more attention. The need to find the right data on the web made search engines a vital tool. First, AltaVista was the king of search engines, but after that, Google took over and conquered the hearts of users worldwide.<br><br>Linux became very popular for web development, with Perl and PHP being used to generate dynamic web pages on the server side. HTML and JavaScript were commonly used on the client-side, along with Java applets. PostgreSQL and MySQL were the RDBMs of choice.<br><br>For Windows web development, MS ASP offered a good interface to MS SQL Server. However, security was a major problem for Microsoft, but it was also an issue for LAMP. SQL injection and remote exploits were common. Hacking is fun.",
			"Challenge": "At Webfactory, we specialized in creating websites, and we made many of them. However, we soon realized that we needed a common platform to build our next projects on. At that time, neither Joomla nor Wordpress existed, so we decided to create our own system for both Windows and Linux, respectively LAMP and MS IIS. Our system was a huge success, and we were able to create more than a hundred sites using it."

			"CPU": "M32R, Pentium 4",
			"Companies": "Renesas, Vector, Microsoft",
			"Text": "Computers have now moved into cars, with dozens of CPUs in every modern vehicle, none of which are manufactured by Intel. Instead, many companies like Mitsubishi and Atmel are involved in this field.<br><br>Embedded development is an enjoyable experience because you are working closer to the hardware, and you can observe how the computers operate beyond the numerous software abstraction layers. In this realm, C is the master. It is the go-to programming language for creating mission-critical and reliable software.<br><br>Debugging is slow and requires the use of a CPU-specific emulator connected to a Windows XP workstation. Most developers use MS Visual Studio as their IDE of choice. The serial CAN network available in the car serves as the communication backbone between in-vehicle devices such as the board computer, tire pressure controller, instrument cluster, and more.",
			"Challenge": "At Johnson Controls, we developed embedded software for the automotive industry. During my time there, the corporation acquired two companies, Sagem and Borg Instruments, which had different proprietary operating systems. However, they had a common client, the Peugeot Citroen Group. In order to create a combined product, I successfully integrated the application layer from one system to the core of the other. The Sagem system used Cooperative multitasking, while the Borg system was somewhere between Simple Control Loop and Interrupt-controlled system."

			"Text": "The internet exploded when people discovered web-based communication. IRC and ICQ were abandoned in favor of social networks. Facebook and Twitter were born and became leaders in information sharing. All news sites now include sharing buttons for these two social titans.<br><br>We also had our mini social revolution in Bulgaria with sites like Aha.bg and Dnes.bg. Traffic increased day by day as users eagerly consumed content and communicated with each other. They shared photos, messages, comments, and videos.",
			"Challenge": "At Investor, we faced two challenges. First, we needed to quickly build a portfolio of sites in two primary categories: media and social networks. After achieving the first goal, we had to deal with the traffic generated by Bulgaria's most popular social network, Aha.bg, and the most popular news site, Dnes.bg.<br><br>Our development cycle was as follows: identify the bottleneck, fix it, increase traffic, celebrate, and then repeat the process of finding the bottleneck. Ultimately, we were able to reach 30 million page views per day by load balancing the application across several servers, sharding the database, partitioning some tables, using Nginx for static content, converting dynamic content to static content (anything that could be made static was served by Nginx), making maximum use of Memcached, and adapting the application to optimize productivity using fast and efficient code rather than big hardware."

			"Companies": "Google, Apple, Facebook",
			"Text": "After smartphones adopted multi-touch capacitive screens and ARM processors with low power consumption, the mobile revolution began. Apple pioneered the use of smartphones with its touch screen technology, starting with the iPhone and later the iPad. Google followed suit by launching the Android OS on devices with capacitive screens. This led to a competition between the two companies, with Apple dominating the high-end market while Google's Android, offered for free, captured the majority of the market share.<br><br>When it comes to making mobile apps, there are two main methods: Native SDKs and HTML5 (JavaScript/HTML5/CSS3). The term \"responsive design\" emerged to describe user interfaces of web pages that look good on all screen resolutions.",

			"Companies": "Oracle, Microsoft, HP, ALU",
			"Text": "The enterprise software world can be complex, with multiple systems often introduced to fill any feature gaps. This can result in solutions consisting of several, sometimes similar, coupled systems. While this approach may result in more licenses sold and more people engaged in delivery and maintenance, it can also contribute to project failures, which are on average around 50%.<br><br>Java and Oracle RDBMs are often the tools of choice, although Microsoft technologies are also popular. The ORM approach to data access competes with the direct one.<br><br>The development process often involves project meetings and traveling to client sites, long MS Lync calls, and the creation of numerous documents in addition to the delivered code.",

			"Companies": "Amazon, Google, Microsoft, SAP, Apple",
			"Text": "Cloud computing started as a luxury option for Silicon Valley startups, providing on-demand capacity. Instead of planning and purchasing the necessary hardware, companies could simply click on the AWS dashboard and access the required resources. However, the end-of-month bill could be significant. Despite the cost, the convenience factor meant adoption was unstoppable. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud also joined the race. Initially, the primary computing unit was a virtual machine, but once tenant isolation became secure enough, containers began to carry the load. Serverless functions were also introduced, allowing code to be executed without knowledge of the actual compute unit. An extensive list of services, ranging from RDBMs to NoSQL databases and memory caches, accompanies these options. Although some established companies have turned back to their own data centers, citing cost savings, this is not the norm. Cloud computing is now the standard runtime for most companies.",
			"Challenge": "During my time at SAP, the company was transitioning from being an ERP behemoth to building its Cloud Platform around the recently created HANA database. My primary responsibility was to create a Disaster Recovery service for the platform."
